    "#### Quick Summary of what I have studied (Differential Equations for Dummies) \n",
    "\n",
    "What is differential equation? **Differential equation is an equation involving derivatives of a function or functions.** \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the definition of derivative? It is the rate of change. Derivative answers how much the output variable changes when the input variable changes by little. To formulate that mathematically, we have the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\lim\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{y(x + h) - y(x)}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So say we have $y(x) = x^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\lim\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we solve it, we will get $\\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + h$ and $h$ is infinitesimal. But calculating this is such a hassle. So, alternatively we can just take the derivative of the function, $y(x)$ and we will arrive at the same answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what we do in **Differential Equation** is making different alterations to the differential equation to acheive its original equation, $y(x)$. And we simply call this process solving for $y(x)$.\n",

    "**Chapter 1** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Classifying linear versus nonlinear equations \n",
    "\n",
    "You call a differential equation linear if it exclusively involves linear terms (that is, terms to the power of 1) of y. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "$1. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 5$ $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ $2. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)$ $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ $3. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = y + 1$ $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ $4. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 3y + 1$ $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ $5. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)y$ $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ $6. \\ \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)y + q(x)$\n",

    "These are different kinds of first order linear differential equations. And different kinds of methods are involved to solve them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** One type of equation doesn't always involve one type of method to solve it, meaning there could be many different techniques to solve one type of equation. In other words, one technique could be used to solve two different types of equations. So choosing what techniques to use for a given equation is the matter of personal preference. But for every type of differential equation, there is always a easiest way and we tend to choose the easiest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Generally,** simple equations like the first two equations given above as examples could be solved by taking integral w.r.t. $x$ on both sides. But the rest of the equations won't be solved that way. That is why we learn different techniques to solve them and prove why those different techniques work. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interesting Point:** Say I have an equation, $\\frac{dy}{dt} = t^3 - t^2$. Well, this looks exactly like the example equation number 2. If we take the integral wrt $t$ on both sides, we get $y(t) = \\frac{1}{4}t^4 - \\frac{1}{3}t^3$. But interestingly enough, the differential equation of $y(t)$, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ could have been expressed in terms of $y$. \n",

    "\n",
    "$g(t) = \\frac{12(t-1)}{t(3t-4)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ doesn't follow the form of example equation number 2. It actually follows the 5th one. So in this case, we have to apply different technique to solve for $y(t)$."

But if we set $f(x,y) = C$, then the variable $z$ is out of the picture. Essentially, there is no z-coordinate anymore. But let's assume there is still z-coordinate. Even if we increase $x$ by some amount, $f(x,y)$ won't have an effect on the z-coordinate. Because it will still be C. Why? Because we set the function equal to C. So when we change $x$ by some amount, what it does is that $y$ will change accordingly, because it is a function of $x$. But the changed $x$ and $y$ will still be on that level C. \n",
